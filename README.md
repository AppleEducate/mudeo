# Looper

The app enables you to easily record multi-track music videos

## Tips

- It's important to use headphones to prevent an echo in the recording

- It can be helpful to record a count-in in the first recording (ie. "1, 2, 3, 4")

- To build up a song start with a beat and then add in layers
